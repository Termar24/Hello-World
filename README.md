# Hello-World
My first repository for testing features and stuff.
Here I'll be following a web tutorial available in this [GitHub Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).

## First of all
I want to test the **branching system** so I can *help* my ==friends== ~~and enemies~~.
> What's a blocknote? The little blocknote asked.
> This is a blocknote, young Padawan.

## Then
1. Prepare myself for studying
2. Rest
3. Prepare again

### What if it doesn't work?
- Go for a walk
- Take some air
- Pet my cat
- T-pose outside for optimal photosynthesis

## When I'm ready to study

'mkdir study && cd study'
'shutdown -f 0'
'while offline; sleep'

{
  import pandas as pd
  def hello_world(x):
  {
    print(x)
  }
}
```
As none of this is important[^1]
I will keep on writing random things

Definition_list
: A list with defitions
: What if it has two definitions?

- [x] Goof around
- [ ] Make my bed
- [x] Cook sth for lunch

[^1]: I will write it down here.
# End of the day
Drink some H~2~O~2~ and fly ^up above^ (just trying out sub-superscripts)
